//This is a simple script that we aim to use in performing a simple fetch content, save img, convert to gif or mp4//
//The key steps are:

    Fetch the webpage content
    Parse the HTML to find the image URL
    Download and save the image
    Use an image library to convert the image to an animation

This allows you to automate the process of generating GIFs or videos from images on webpages using Python//

//Use the requests library to fetch the webpage content//
import requests

url = 'https://example.com'
//change this to an input field box for the url//

response = requests.get(url)
html_content = response.content

//Parse the HTML content to find the image URL using a library like #BeautifulSoup//

from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html.parser')
image_url = soup.find('img')['src']

//Download the image using requests and save it to a file//

image_response = requests.get(image_url)
with open('image.jpg', 'wb') as file:
    file.write(image_response.content)

//Use a #library like #imageio to convert the image to a GIF or MP4 animation//
//ifio=gif, create a GIF animation named animation.gif with each frame displayed for duration= seconds.//

import imageio

images = [imageio.imread('image.jpg')]
imageio.mimsave('animation.gif', images, duration=0.5)


//ifio=mp4, create an MP4 video with frame ratte at 24fps//

imageio.mimsave('animation.mp4', images, fps=24)
